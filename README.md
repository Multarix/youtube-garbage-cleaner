# Youtube Garbage Cleaner
Removes misc/ useless trash from the youtube webpage such as links to shorts, buying premium or just other generally useless links nobody in their right mind cares about.

Specifically it removes the following links from the sidebar:
- Shorts
- Trending
- Music
- News
- Sport
- Learning
- Fashion & Beauty
- Youtube Kids
- Youtube Red/ Youtube Premium

This should not flag any of youtube's "anti-adblock" filters, at least as far as I'm aware.
Youtube may change their pages layout and as such all or certain parts may not be filtered out. In this event, open an issue and I'll take a look at it.
